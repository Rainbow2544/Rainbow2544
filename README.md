### Hi there 👋 I'm Rainbow Ou!
🎓 I'm a computer science graduate student at University of Auckland, passionate about exploring various aspects of software development.

📚 Currently, I'm studying at Mission Ready to enhance my technical skills and deepen my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology. I'm focusing on honing my skills in web development like React.js, Node.js and Typescript.

💻 My areas of expertise include front-end and back-end web development, and machine learning. I have hands-on experience with Python, JavaScript, and SQL.

🚀 I love working on exciting projects and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems.

📫 Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainbow-ou-596a43204/)!

⚡️ Fun fact: I enjoy playing video games, with my current favorite being "Fire Emblem Engage". Hiking and traveling are activities I cherish, and I also have a keen interest in painting, although I don't always have as much time for it as I would like.

Let's connect and collaborate on interesting projects! 😄
